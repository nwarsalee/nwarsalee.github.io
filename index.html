      <h1 class="about_title">About Me</h1>
      <h2 class="about_subtitle">Hello, I'm <span class="name">Nabeel</span>!<br>Here's a little bit about me,</h2>
      <div class="about_text">
        <p>I am a 2nd year Computer Science student at Carleton University in Ottawa. I was born and raised in Ottawa
          for all my life. My parents come from a small island in the Indian Ocean called Mauritius (maybe you've head
          of
          it, but probably not). They left everything they had and moved all the way to Canada to let my younger brother
          and I have a better life. All their support they have given me throughout the years motivates me to do better
          and make them proud.
        </p>
        <p>My affinity for technology started at a very young age. I was fortunate to have many computers in the house
          since my dad was an IT.
          He would teach me many things like what the different parts did and how to assemble them all to make a
          computer.
          It was when I was in high school that I started getting interested in computer programming.
          I started teaching myself through online resources and then I took a programming course at my high school.
          It's these events that helped lead me to where I am today.
          <br><br>Below are some more interests of mine...
        </p>

    <div class="about_interests">
      <div class="about_interests_block">
        <h3>Sports and Fitness</h3>
        <p>I've always loved playing sports. My favourite sport is football (aka soccer) but I also like to play
          basketball.
          I like doing other outdoor activites such as cycling, swimming and even wakeboarding. I try to go to the gym
          as much as I can.
          Exercise and sports is something I value a lot. I see it as another tool to help solve problems and another
          outlet to practice teamwork and critical thinking.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="about_interests_block">
        <h3>Travelling</h3>
        <p>Travelling is something I've been very fortunate to experience and hope to do more of in the future.
          In 2018 our family went on a month-long trip back to Mauritius and also stopped in Paris, France for a week.
          In 2019 I had the opportunity to go to Japan with my brother and cousins and it was an amazing experience.
          My next destination will be somewhere in the Mediterranean!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="about_interests_block">
        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>Gaming is a passion that grew alongside my love for technology.
          My cousins introduced my brother and I to classic games on the N64 and SNES like the original <i>Super Smash
            Bros</i> and <i>Donkey Kong Country</i>.
          My current main game I play is <i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i> but when I have more time I like
          playing story-driven singleplayer games or party games with friends.
          I find games are a very powerful and creative tool to showcase new technological development.

            <p class="portfolio_descr">Zombie arcade game made with my partner Eren Sulutas. Based in Processing, the
              game applies many fundamental programming concepts such as, Object Oriented Design, use of 2D arrays,
              ArayLists, file writing and more. My main role on this project was the game mechanics and logic. I created
              things like the movement, the random spawning of zombies and how the zombies interact with the player and
              more. For the whole breakdown of the project, please visit the Github repo.</p>
