Based in Processing, the game applies many fundamental programming concepts such as, Object Oriented Design, use of 2D arrays, ArayLists, file writing and more. My main role on this project was the game mechanics and logic. I created things like the movement, the random spawning of zombies and how the zombies interact with the player and more.
